XMOS Serial To Ethernet UDP Server Test Script
==============================================

Introduction
-------------

This script provides UDP server functionality in order to query S2E 
available on the network or change ip address of S2E devices    

Usage:

python udp_server.py

Required Python Modules
-------------------------

Requires socket library if using in MAC or Linux

WINDOWS USERS:

It is recommended that windows users use Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/). 
Install setuptools as per the instructions on the site above and install 
the required libraries as described above.

Code structure
---------------

* udp_server.py - Implements UDP server functionality in order to complement
     S2E device management in the deployed network. 


UDP Server Software Usage
-------------------------


* UDP Server IP address selection
     Script displays IP address of your host system; this is the default ip
       used for UDP communication
     If user intends to modify ip address, option 'n' may be selected and 
       new ip address for the host is provided

* UDP Server S2E options selection
     A couple of user options are provided in order to perform the 
     following functions:
     
     Option 1 - Query S2E presence
       Format:         XMOS S2E REPLY
       Message Type:   Broadcast
       Usage:          Identifies S2Es available on the network
       Note:           None

       The received response is in the format: 
       XMOS S2E VER:XXXX;MAC:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx;IP:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
        VER --> Firmware Version
        MAC --> MAC Address
        IP  --> IP address of the S2E device
     
     Displays all the availabe S2E in the network in the format specified above
     
     Option 2 - Change IP address of a S2E
       
       Displays all availabe S2Es on the network. User selects an appropriate S2E 
       from the list and provides new IP address
     	
       Format:         XMOS S2E IPCHANGE aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd
       Message Type:   Unicast
       Usage:          IP address of a specific S2E can be modified
       Note:           Option 1 should be used prior to using this option
     
       S2E IP is changed to the new IP address. Upon selecting option 1, 
       IP change is ensured
     
     Option 3 - Change IP address of S2E in Broadcast mode
       Format:         XMOS S2E IPCHANGE 0.0.0.0
       Message Type:   Broadcast
       Usage:          IP address of a all S2E can be modified to DHCP assignment
       Note:           Option 1 should be used prior to using this option.
                        It is important that only the intended S2Es for which, the IP 
                        address is invalid should be made available in the network; 
                        all other S2Es should be removed from the network.

       S2E IP is changed to the DHCP assigned IP address. Upon selecting option 1, 
       the new IP can be known
