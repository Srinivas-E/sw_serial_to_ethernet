XMOS Serial & Serial To Ethernet Test Scripts
===============================================

Introduction
-------------

These scripts are designed to exercise the serial and serial to ethernet 
functionality of this multi-uart software component. They provide the 
following functionality:

* Seed based random data generation (allows repeatability of tests)
* Iteration through lists of targets
* Support for different test durations (cycles / seconds / minutes / hours 
    / days)
* Logging / Verbose / Progress display modes
* Support for the following test configurations
    * Test for echoing of serial data
    * Test for bursts of serial data
    * Telnet connection response by S2E application
    * Telnet maximum session test
    * Telnet echoing by S2E application (agnostic to whether it is an internal 
        or serial loop back)
    * Telnet cross loop back testing - checking that data goes out one 
        telnet session and is received in another
    * Telnet read/write command check for S2E application configuration
    * Streaming of data from ethernet telnet session to be received by 
        serial device
    

To get full usage and help information run:

python s2e_test.py -h

Required Python Modules
-------------------------

The scripts required the following:

* argparse
* pexpect
* pySerial

These can all be installed by using 'easy_install'. Example:

easy_install argparse

If you don't have easy_install then you need to install setuptools (see 
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)

WINDOWS USERS:

It is recommended that windows users use Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/). 
Install setuptools as per the instructions on the site above and install 
the required libraries as described above.

Within Cygwin the -l option will not pick up any devices - however they
can be accessed via /dev/ttySxx where xx is the COM port ID minus 1. So 
COM11 becomes /dev/ttyS10

Code structure
---------------

The code is designed to allow the easy implmentation of tests by extending
some base objects. The files in the src directory are described as follows:

* xmos_test.py - Implements the base functionality of the tests, provides
    logging, standardised print output, progress reporting and test duration
    configuration. Every test/test suite inherits this object. Also provides
    basic XMOS test exceptions
* serial_tests.py - Defines serial test class which has methods for serial
    configuration of the serial port. Also contains the test suite for
    serial only tests
* telnet_tests.py - Defines the telnet test class which has methods for telnet
    connection to the S2E application. Also contains the test suite for
    telnet only tests
* s2e_system_tests.py - Defines the tests functions for telnet and serial test
    combinations
* s2e_test.py - Top level file that handles the parsing of arguments and running
    of the tests. Contains main()
