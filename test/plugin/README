This directory contains a plugin for the XMOS simulator that allows
the developer to test the UART module. It relies on the demo echo
application and transmits a random sequence of bytes.

The plugin can be configured and installed using `make all`.

Some preconfigured run configurations of the plugin are available
via the Makefile. These are -

runsim_uart0_pol0 - this runs the simulator with the plugin configured
to operate on the 1st UART channel on the 8A and 8B ports @115200kbps,
with even parity, 1 stop bit and a start bit polarity of 0 

runsim_uart0_pol1 - this runs the simulator with the plugin configured
to operate on the 1st UART channel on the 8A and 8B ports @115200kbps,
with even parity, 1 stop bit and a start bit polarity of 1

If invalid arguments are provided to the plugin then the following 
help message will be printed -

Usage:
  Uart_test.dll/so <package> <UART RX pin> <UART TX pin> <package> <ext clk pin> <start_bit_polarity>

See the makefile for working examples
